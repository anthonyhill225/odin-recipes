    <h2>How to Make Instant-Ramen-Carbonara</h2>
    <P>
        This instant ramen carbonara is my take on carbonara, made with ingredients you probably have on hand. I grew up eating ramen noodles nearly every day, and am always looking for ways to flavor them without using the seasoning packet.
    </P>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>6 cups water</li>
        <li>3 (3 ounce) packages instant ramen noodles, seasoning packets discarded</li>
